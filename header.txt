[FEATURES]      Reverse Shell
                Session Hijacking

[TARGET]        Windows 10+

[DESCRIPTION]   This program gives us reverse shell access to target machines.
                It also allows us to perform session hijacking by taking advantage of the remote debugging feature of Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.
                OpenSSH must be installed on both the host and target machines in order to use the session hijacking feature.
                Browse to http://localhost:80/sessions to get a list of all sessions.
                In order to expose this server to the internet, the firewall in your router must be disabled (look for DMZ Hosting in router settings).
                External Dependencies:
                curl - curl is a tool for transferring data from or to a server using URLs.
                sshd - sshd (OpenSSH Daemon) is the daemon program for ssh.
